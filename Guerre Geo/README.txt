As part of one of my classes on software engineering, we created a new game called Guerre Geo which is a educational, geo-caching, augmented reality game inspired from Pokemon Go. We developed the entire documentation for the game, all 66 pages.
We included Project Overview, Requirements, Design, Test Plans, Project Issues and glossary. 

This is our attempt at being a Business Analyst.
